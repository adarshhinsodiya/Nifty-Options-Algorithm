# Retry and Backoff Logic Implementation

This document outlines the retry and backoff mechanism implemented in the Nifty Options Trading System for handling API failures and session management.

## Overview

The system implements a robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff and jitter to handle transient failures when interacting with the Breeze API. The implementation includes:

1. **Automatic Retries**: Configurable number of retry attempts for failed API calls
2. **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing delay between retry attempts
3. **Jitter**: Random variation in backoff time to prevent thundering herd problem
4. **Session Management**: Automatic session renewal before expiration
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error classification and handling

## Key Components

### 1. DataProvider._api_call_with_retry()

The core retry mechanism that wraps all Breeze API calls. It:
- Ensures valid session before each attempt
- Handles session expiration and renewal
- Implements exponential backoff with jitter
- Provides detailed logging for debugging

### 2. Session Management

- Automatic session renewal before expiration (with 5-minute buffer)
- WebSocket reconnection after session renewal
- Configurable session timeout (default: 23h 55m)

### 3. Error Handling

- Specific handling for session expiration
- API error status code checking
- Comprehensive logging of retry attempts and failures

## Configuration

Retry behavior can be configured via the following parameters:

```python
self._max_retries = 3        # Maximum number of retry attempts
self._initial_backoff = 1    # Initial backoff in seconds
self._max_backoff = 30       # Maximum backoff in seconds
```

## Testing

### Test Script

A test script is available at `tests/test_retry_logic.py` to verify the retry functionality:

1. **Session Renewal Test**: Verifies session expiration and renewal
2. **API Retry Test**: Tests retry behavior with valid and invalid API calls
3. **Order Placement Test**: End-to-end test of order placement with retry logic

### Running Tests

```bash
python -m tests.test_retry_logic
```

### Logs

Test results and debug information are logged to:
- Console output
- `retry_test.log` file

## Best Practices

1. **Idempotency**: Ensure API operations are idempotent when using retries
2. **Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeouts for API calls
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor retry rates and failure patterns
4. **Circuit Breaking**: Consider implementing circuit breakers for persistent failures

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Session Expiration**: Check logs for session renewal messages
2. **Rate Limiting**: Monitor for 429 (Too Many Requests) responses
3. **Network Issues**: Verify internet connectivity and API endpoint availability
